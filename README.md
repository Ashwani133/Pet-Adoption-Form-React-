# Overview

The app has three main parts:

Header: Displays the appâ€™s title.
Form: Users fill in details like name, contact info, and pet preferences.
Table: Shows the submitted form data after submission.

# Learning Goals

- Build React components (Header, Form, Table).
- Use useState to manage form input and state.
- Pass data between components using props.

# Customs

- Custom Form Validation: Enhance the form by adding custom validation functions. For example:
  - Validate that the pet name, breed, and adopter's name fields have a minimum length (e.g., 3 characters).
  - Ensure the email is in a valid format (e.g., using a regex).
  - Check that the phone number is a valid 10-digit number.
  - Add validation that runs on the onChange event to give users real-time feedback while typing.
